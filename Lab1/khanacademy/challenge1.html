    <h1>Last Hero</h1>
    <p>
        The world grew quiet, the sky turned gray<br />
        A lone soul walked where shadows lay. <br />
        No crown to bear, no songs to sing,<br />
        A weary heart, a broken wing.<br />
        <br>
        Through fire and frost, through endless night,<br />
        They held the line, the fading light.<br />
        Not for glory, nor for gain,<br />
        But to shield the world from pain.<br />

        When dawn awoke, the hero gone,<br />
        Their sacrifice lived on and on.<br />
